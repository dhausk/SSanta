   <h2>Hello! Welcome! to the simple gift exchange generator.</h2>

     We do not keep your email adresses or names, we just assign a person to eachother 
     and send them an email of who they have. And of course we send the person who is 
     organizing it a list of who everoue has in case they forget or loose their email.
