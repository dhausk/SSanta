    <h1>Why make another Secret Santa Generator?</h1>
    <section class="container">
    <p>Before the Christmas of 2018, I was looking for a Secret Santa Generator
      and each one I found wanted me to create an account. Once you created an
      each person in your list had to sign up for a group and make an account.
      Then once everyone signed up, It made you draw names together. 
    </p>
    <p>As you can tell that was too much work, I just wanted to send a few emails with a
      persons Santa and giftee. Plus Im pretty sure they sold my info fund their service.
    </p>
    <p>So I decided to create a my own Secret Santa. One that just took in a bunch names,
       randomily paired everyone up and just send out who you have. No registrations, 
       no creepy face book ads. Simple and right to the point. Have a great Gift Exchange!
