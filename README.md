# SSanta Generator

SSanta Generator allows users to create a gift exchange group with options to set the gift value limit, and whether or not to allow the organizer to have a copy of the gift exchange pairs. Once you enter all the names and their emails you check it over once and SSanta sends "Santa" in the group their gift recipient.

## Technology

SSanta Generator is built using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [VueX](https://vuex.vuejs.org/), [Vue-Router](https://router.vuejs.org/), [vue-map-fields](https://github.com/maoberlehner/vuex-map-fields) package, and using [BootSwatach](https://bootswatch.com) for styling.  On the back end we have a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server using the [nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/) package to send emails to each recipient.
